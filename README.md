**THIS REPOSITORY IS BUILDING FOR OPENLIST DEVELOPMENT, FOR VERSIONS, GO TO OPENLIST OR OPENLISTBUILDER**

Automated builds of [OpenList](https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList) from latest source code. This repository provides pre-compiled binaries built directly from the official OpenList repository.

## 📦 Download Binaries
Get the latest pre-built binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/ILoveScratch2/OpenListBuilder/releases) page.

## 🔧 Build Process
We automatically build new binaries when:
1. Official OpenList repository updates
2. Dependencies change
3. Manual workflow trigger

Build frequency: Daily at 00:00 UTC



## ❓ Why This Exists
Since OpenList doesn't provide official newest binaries, this project:
- Saves compilation time for end-users
- Provides verified build scripts
- Ensures latest security patches

## 🛑 Disclaimer
This is an unofficial project. Not affiliated with OpenList developers.  
Binaries are provided AS-IS without warranties.
